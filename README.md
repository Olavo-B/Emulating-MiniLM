<img src="misc/img/logotipo-UFV1-4-1024x804.png" alt="ufv_logo" align="right" width="75">


This project aims to emulate the MiniLM model proposed by [Wang et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10957). This project is part of the course INF721 - Deep Learning at Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa, undertaken during the second semester of 2024 as part of the Master's in Computer Science program.

## Usage

To install the docker image and all requiriments, run the following command:

```bash
install.sh
```
This command will build and run the docker image


To just run the docker image, run the following command:

```bash
run.sh
```
